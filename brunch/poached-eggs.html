    <h3>Method</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Half-fill a wide pan with boiling salted water, and bring it to a light simmer over a medium heat.</li>

            <li>Crack one of the eggs into a cup and gently pour it into the water in one fluid movement. Repeat with the rest of the eggs. You’ll see them begin to cook immediately – don’t worry if the edges look a little scruffy. Depending on the pan, a really soft poached egg should take around 2 minutes and a soft to firm one will need 4 minutes (it depends on the size of the eggs and whether you’re using them straight from the fridge).</li>

            <li>To check whether they’re done, remove one carefully from the pan with a slotted spoon and give it a gentle push with a teaspoon. If it feels too soft (use your instincts), put it back and give the eggs a minute or two more in the water to firm up.</li>

            <li>When they’re ready, remove them to some kitchen paper to dry off and serve with buttered toast and a sprinkle of sea salt and black pepper.</li>
        </ol>

    <h4>Tips</h4>
        <p>Use the best-quality eggs you can afford. Remember: the better the quality, the better the flavour. You can tell whether an egg is fresh by cracking it on to a saucer. If the yolk stands up and the white isn't watery, it's as fresh as a daisy.</p>
